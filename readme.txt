Wetlands are vital actors in our ecosystem, providing biophysical regulation, food, and wildlife habitats. As urban development and 
anthropogenic activity expand, wetlands grow vulnerable to destruction and shrinkage. The wetland analysis tool was developed to 
evaluate the potential impact caused by infrastructure in relation to its proximity to wetlands. 

This analysis tool was inspired by the GoTriangle's discontinued light rail project, whose proposed path flanks several wetland areas, 
and intended for transportation infrastructure specifically. However, other features of interest can be substituted--forests 
for wetlands, housing developments for roads, etc.
